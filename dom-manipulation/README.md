In this project, I will develop a dynamic web application that generates, manages, and filters content based on user interactions. 
This project focuses on advanced DOM manipulation techniques, web storage, and handling JSON data.
I learnT how to:

Create and manipulate dynamic content using JavaScript.
Persist data across browser sessions using local storage and session storage.
Import and export JSON data to manage the state of your application.
Implement a dynamic content filtering system.
Sync local data with a server and handle potential conflicts.
